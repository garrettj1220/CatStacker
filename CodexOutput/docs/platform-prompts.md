# Platform Skin Generation Prompts
Use these prompts exactly in your favorite image tool. Each one describes the same friendly, bold, low-poly-friendly art style the CatStacker canvas uses: narrow horizontal platforms (roughly 160×40 pixels), tactile materials, high-contrast rims, and subtle glow or texture details so they read clearly against darker night-sky scraps. The prompts assume a pastel/digital-paint vibe with gentle gradients and playful accents, so the resulting assets feel cohesive with the existing cats. Treat every prompt as a standalone command; no extra adjectives are needed unless you want to tweak the color story.

Before using the prompts, confirm that each generated strip is cropped to the narrow rectangular format, trimmed to the same height, and exported with a transparent background or gentle gradient so it can slice easily into the stacking grid.

1. **Mahogany Glow Beam** — `A hand-painted wooden beam platform with exaggerated grain, deep mahogany base, and glowing teal edge highlights, sized for a 160x40 px strip, slightly beveled and with soft shadowing that reads well against a night sky background.`
2. **Cerulean Crystal Strand** — `A crystalline ice platform rendered in stylized low-poly geometry, translucent cerulean surfaces, faint internal glow, and reflective rim light that suggests cold sparkle without being slippery; keep it narrow and horizontal so it fits the drop zone.`
3. **Neon Tube Pier** — `A futuristic neon tube platform with chrome underside, diffuse violet glow, and a thin grid accent on top; add subtle rim lighting so it can cut through darker backdrops and the cats can land on it visually.`
4. **Mushroom Moss Slab** — `A floating mossy stone platform with scattered tiny mushrooms, warm amber lichen, and subtle particle dust at its edges—texture should feel tactile but remain simple enough for a 160x40 sprite.`
5. **Graffiti Concrete Plank** — `A bold graffiti-painted concrete block: flat slate surface with colorful spray paint strokes, bright cyan drips, and intentional chipped corners for a playful urban vibe while keeping the silhouette clean.`
6. **Rusted Rivet Beam** — `A seamless rusted metal beam with riveted seams, gradient orange-to-brown patina, and a faint glowing weld line; keep lighting consistent so it can pair with both dark and bright backgrounds.`
7. **Rune Bark Limb** — `An organic tree limb platform with bark texture, glowing runes etched along the top edge, and a soft mossy underside; limit the color palette to emerald and gold to keep clarity when stacked.`
8. **Plum Gloss Terrace** — `A sleek lacquered platform with glossy finish, deep plum base, and thin gold trim; add a mirrored reflection to the top surface to emphasize its premium feel without distracting from gameplay.`
9. **Cat Bed Cloud** — `A plush cat-bed-inspired platform with bouclé surface, mauve upholstery, golden tufted seams, and a soft glowing halo all around; keep the strip low profile so it holds the cats like a fluffy cloud while matching the cozy stylized palette.`
10. **Colosseum Archway** — `A segmented stone arena platform with carved Roman columns, sun-warmed travertine texture, and shadowed archways; add dusty gold highlights along the edges so it reads like a triumphant stage under a twilight sky.`
11. **Jungle Palm Plank** — `A timber platform wrapped with palm fronds, verdant moss, and tiny tropical blossoms; include woven vine bindings and scattered sunlight shafts so it feels like a jungle canopy perch.`
12. **Beachside Coralbar** — `A seaside runway made of sun-bleached driftwood, coral inlays, and spray-painted turquoise stripes; drop some sandy grit on the top and a faint splash reflection to evoke a calm tide pool.`
13. **Castle Rampart** — `A regal stone battlement with heraldic banners, crenelated silhouette, and deep bluish-gray texture; add subtle gold trim and weathered chalk lines to give it a noble storybook look without adding visual noise.`
14. **Human Craft Plank** — `A handmade patchwork platform composed of recycled planks, hand-painted whimsical doodles, and stitched fabric strips; keep the colors bright and saturated but the overall form clean so it reads like a human-built fort while blending with the stylized cartoon cats.`

Use whichever prompt matches the mood you want, then slice the resulting art into the CatStacker tile format.
